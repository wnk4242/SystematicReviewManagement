Journal Article,Unidirectional and bidirectional relationships between financial parenting and financial self-efficacy: Does student loan status matter?,"Using longitudinal data and a cross-lagged, multigroup panel design, we examined unidirectional and bidirectional relationships between financial parenting and young adults?? financial self-efficacy during the transition to adulthood. Because increasing college costs and student loan debt have changed the financial landscape of achieving higher education, we examined effects over time under 2 distinct conditions: a debt-financed college education and a debt-free college education. Analyses included the effects of 2 types of financial parenting: implicit role modeling and explicit communication. The sample was drawn from the Arizona Pathways to Life Success (APLUS) project, a cohort study of college students enrolled full time at a public university in the fall of 2007. Participants provided data at 3 time points across 5 years. The sample included 850 student loan borrowers and 800 nonborrowers. We found unidirectional patterns for both nonborrowers and borrowers depending on the type of financial parenting: Parents?? explicit financial communication before college predicted higher levels of financial self-efficacy during freshman year for nonborrowers, whereas parents?? implicit modeling before college predicted higher levels of financial self-efficacy during freshman year for borrowers. Financial self-efficacy led to less frequent explicit parental financial communication for nonborrowers after college but was associated with more frequent explicit parental financial communication during college for borrowers. Our findings suggest that explicit communication regarding basic finance principles is likely sufficient to support financial self-efficacy in a debt-free context, whereas observing parents?? responsible financial behaviors may be beneficial for young adults who incur student loan debt.

Journal Article,Cognitive reserve mitigates decline in executive functioning following hepatobiliary diseases.,"The cognitive reserve hypothesis postulates that lifelong cognitive stimulation establishes a buffer that is instrumental in maintaining cognitive health. To examine this conceptual proposition in detail, we applied a novel, more general conceptual view that included recent models of vulnerability and examined whether the longitudinal association between hepatobiliary diseases and later decline in executive functioning across 6 years varied by cognitive reserve. For this purpose, we investigated longitudinal data from 897 older individuals (M = 74.33 years) tested using the Trail Making Test (TMT) in two waves 6 years apart. Individuals reported information on key commonly used indicators of lifelong cognitive reserve build-up (i.e., education, work, and participation in leisure activity) and hepatobiliary diseases. The results revealed a significant interaction of hepatobiliary diseases with participation in leisure activity on latent change in executive functioning. Specifically, only in individuals with little (but not greater) participation in leisure activity did hepatobiliary diseases significantly predict a steeper decline in executive functioning over 6 years (i.e., increases in TMT finishing time). In conclusion, the unfavorable aftereffects of hepatobiliary diseases on a later decline in executive functioning seem to be mitigated in individuals who have built up greater cognitive reserve via participation in leisure activity during their life.

Comment/Reply,Multiple perspectives on disseminating and implementing evidenced??based treatments: Demand and supply.,"Comments on an article by B. Karlin and L. Brenner (see record 2020-55010-001). Karlin and Brenner (2020) describe the development of ??pull strategies?? to increase demand for evidence-based psychological treatments and facilitate consumer engagement once psychotherapy begins. The two ??pull strategies?? of (a) direct-to-consumer education and outreach (DCEO), and a (b) shared decision making (SDM) session(s) have the potential to increase mental health literacy and shape attitudes and behaviors of providers. These efforts aim to bring veterans ??in the door?? and increase their personal agency, readiness, and engagement in treatment??ideally leading to improved adherence, retention, and outcomes. It is a reasonable expectation that providers who are insufficiently prepared to deliver the preferred and indicated treatments will have increased motivation for professional development in those areas. As the authors describe characteristics of veterans associated with lower behavioral health literacy, they acknowledge that these are shared by many non-veterans as well. The authors appreciate Karlin and Brenner's emphasis on the need for common and standard language in developing tools to facilitate shared decision making. Direct-to-consumer education and outreach and SDM have the potential to advance behavioral health science and practice. We welcome confirmation that they help narrow the research-to-practice gap. It would be even more exciting if they include adoption of more novel models of delivery and truly succeed in closing the treatment gap.

Journal Article,The state of progress in diversity and inclusion initiatives: Perspectives for consulting psychology.,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are critical issues for leaders and organizations. Although they have been important for a long time, recently amplified attention to DEI serves as a backdrop to this special issue of Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research, which focuses on the state of progress in initiatives for diversity and inclusion across industries and contexts and includes a varied set of articles that, together, begin to create a picture of both where consulting psychology is with regard to DEI and where it needs to go. As the first collection of articles in this journal specifically focused on such initiatives, it is both timely and much needed. The articles, written by scholars and practitioners, include reflections on practice, case studies, and calls for studying a greater range of populations. It is hoped that this collection will inspire more sustained, systematic, and systemic work on DEI by consulting psychologists.

Journal Article,Everyday challenges to the practice of desirable difficulties: Introduction to the forum.,"This article presents an introduction to the essays featured in the current issue of Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition. The contributors to the forum each address the barriers to implementing desirably difficult practices. Some essays in this collection describe practice-oriented challenges and successes; others tell us more about where research must be focused in the future to deliver on the promise inherent in the approach. In math education and other areas, teachers and students alike do not seem to understand the crutch function of undesirable easiness and prefer to hang onto illusions of skill, reinforced by past short-term achievements. The inevitable uneasiness in abandoning crutches in favor of new methods is one motivational factor that confounds the application of desirably difficult practices. The contributions to the forum describe some impressive successes, but they also fully explore the obstacles and challenges of moving beyond the laboratory and classroom demonstrations of desirably difficult practices as we contemplate serious application of the science of learning and memory. The irony of this forum is that it is published in a time when going through the motions of learning might be at an all-time high, with Covid-19 introducing undesirable difficulties as we watch our educational systems make major allowances in order to punch tickets on time.

Journal Article,Faculty attitudes toward college students with criminal records.,"This inquiry explores university faculty attitudes toward college students with criminal records to better understand whether professors view them differently than the general student body. Utilizing a framework informed by the concept of stigma and existing research on individuals with criminal records in traditional higher education settings, we analyzed faculty responses to nine scenarios related to their encounters with students on campus. The 229 survey participants had relatively supportive reactions, but their views were significantly more negative about college students with criminal records compared with other students. Faculty exhibited particularly stigmatizing attitudes toward college students convicted of serious violent offenses.

Column/Opinion,Reflective practice: Finding synergy between psychological science and competency??based frameworks.,"There are several ways in which greater synergy can and must be accomplished. The gaps between basic science on psychological processes, clinical research, clinical practice, and clinical education must be reduced, and integration and translational research must be emphasized for the discipline to advance (Fudge et al., 2016; Teachman et al., 2012). This will require greater collaboration and more bidirectional knowledge flow; information must flow from practitioners and educators to basic scientists and from basic scientists and clinical researchers to practitioners and educators. It also will mean that all parties engage in open dialogue, focus on seeking common ground, and reduce the burden of the existing schisms in the field on future generations of clinical psychologists (Hershenberg & Drabick, 2012). These changes in landscape will provide the backdrop upon which scientists, practitioners, and educators can co-author scholarly articles in which they provide user-friendly guides to basic psychological science findings that are applicable to the day-to-day practice of clinical psychologists and clinical educators. For example, related to reflective practice in clinical psychology, a team of psychological science scholars, practicing psychologists, and clinical supervisors partnered to shed light on the relevance of cognitive biases, heuristics, and logical fallacies on decision-making in clinical practice and training (Bowes, Ammirati, Costello, Basterfield, & Lilienfeld, 2020). Only when the cultural divides in our discipline are redressed (Restifo & Phelan, 2011), will competency-based models of education and training thrive and will our understanding of, and training in, such complex psychological processes of reflective practice evolve.

Journal Article,The bidirectional relationship between physical health and memory.,"Individuals typically experience changes in physical health and cognitive ability across the life span. Although these constructs dynamically relate to one another, the temporal ordering of dynamic changes in physical health and cognitive ability is not well-established. Therefore, we examined the temporal ordering of the dynamic, bidirectional relationship between physical health and memory across ages 50??87 with Bivariate Dual Change Score Models (BDCSM). Employing a model-comparison approach, we tested whether inclusion of specific directional coupling parameters resulted in a meaningful improvement in model fit, controlling for education, gender, and race. The current sample included 9,103 individuals who participated in Waves 4??11 (1998??2012) of the Health and Retirement Study. Results indicated that both memory and physical health declined across ages 50??87. Furthermore, level of memory at a given time point was positively associated with subsequent change in physical health, meaning higher memory was linked to less decline in physical health by the subsequent time point. The opposite effect, namely physical health predicting memory, was much weaker. Age differences were also evident in the bidirectional coupling model, indicating that old-old individuals (i.e., ages 75??87) exhibited a much stronger coupling effect from memory to change in physical health than younger individuals (i.e., ages 50??74). In conclusion, memory buffers decline in physical health across mid-to-later life, and this effect is especially strong at older ages.

Journal Article,Performance monitoring during categorization with and without prior knowledge: A comparison of confidence calibration indices with the certainty criterion.,"Subjective confidence reports are used in numerous research paradigms to examine the extent to which participants are aware of their performance in a task. By examining the discrepancy between objective performance and subjective confidence ratings, inferences can be made about the conditions in which participants have greater explicit knowledge of the representations and processes used to complete a task. In the current study, we examined the effects of prior knowledge on subjective assessments of performance using a categorisation task wherein lists of features that defined exemplars shared latent feature associations on the basis of prior knowledge or had no prior associations. Using 2 methods for computing confidence, we demonstrate the strengths and limitations of these measures of subjective awareness. Whereas our findings replicated the effect of prior knowledge on learning, our results challenge the role of explicit and implicit knowledge suggested by previous research using a similar paradigm.

Journal Article,Diverse pathways to graduate education attainment.,"The study contributes new evidence on the factors associated with graduate education outcomes within the first few years of completing college, with particular attention on the moderating influence of racial/ethnic identity. Drawing on Education Longitudinal Study, 2002??2012 data, analyses examined how students?? ascribed, entering college characteristics, and undergraduate educational experiences are associated with subsequent progression into and through graduate education across racial/ethnic groups. The results uncovered important evidence that graduate attainment is highly conditional on, or moderated by, racial/ethnic identity.

Journal Article,Improving engagement in evidence??based psychological treatments among Veterans: Direct??to??consumer outreach and pretreatment shared decision??making.,"Despite growing empirical support over the past half??century, evidence??based psychotherapies (EBPs) remain infrequently delivered. Organized efforts within large public and private systems, including the Veterans Health Administration, have brought significant optimism to closing the research??to??practice gap. Notwithstanding robust improvements, few Veterans and non??Veterans receive EBPs. The current article expands implementation knowledge and practice by extending focus of EBP implementation from provider, system, and policy??level requirements to key patient??level barriers and associated ??pull strategies?? for promoting interest, demand, and engagement. Specifically, the article presents a public health and clinical engagement strategy and innovations developed by the authors leveraging strategic actions for increasing EBP uptake and engagement in two key areas: (a) direct??to??consumer outreach and education, and (b) pretreatment shared decision??making.

Specifically, we demonstrate that an 8th grader with no prior mental health education or training can pass a test intended to assess expert levels of knowledge obtained from a workshop. Implications of these findings on the validity of specialty credentials and the public??s trust in them are considered.
